Learning Sorting Algorithms in C

This repository served as a learning playground to help me understand and implement sorting algorithms in the C programming language.

Contents:
- Implementation of popular sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and more.
- Code examples with clear explanations to help understand the inner workings of each algorithm.
- Efficiency and time/space complexities of the implemented algorithms.

By studying and experimenting with the code in this repository, I enhanced my understanding of sorting algorithms, their time complexity, and their applications in real-world scenarios.
